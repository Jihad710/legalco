                    <p className='text-justify'>As we won't be meeting in person, it's crucial to outline the agreement terms beforehand. If you have any questions about LegalCO, please feel free to reach out.Within this agreement, we've referred to our service as the 'service,' you as the 'user,'and this agreement as the 'agreement.'</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>If you plan to use our 'Common Needs' feature, you confirm that you're over 18 years old, fully capable of abiding by the terms, obligations, and warranties related to document creation, and are well-informed about these.

                    <p className='text-justify'>2. LEGALCO ONLY PROVIDES A MEDIUM FOR INTERACTION</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>LegalCO serves as an online platform and mobile application designed to facilitate
communication, connections, and online consultations (via video, audio, and text)
between legal professionals and potential users seeking legal services. It acts as a
medium for information exchange, with the ultimate aim of establishing professional
relationships. However, it's important to note that LegalCO does not guarantee the
successful matching of users with lawyers, and it does not take a stance on whether a
lawyer-client relationship is formed.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>It's worth emphasizing that LegalCO operates as a bridge for interaction and does not accept responsibility for any losses experienced by users. Users are encouraged to take action against any individuals they believe have caused harm, rather than directing complaints or blame towards LegalCO. Additionally, the platform is not liable for services provided outside its framework.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>LegalCO does not directly offer services to customers; any services provided by
individuals are their own responsibility. Thus, LegalCO disclaims liability for any
incorrect information, anti-government activities, inappropriate language, exchanged
documents, or misuse that might occur. It functions solely as an online platform and
holds no liability in these matters</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>If you join LegalCO as a lawyer or user, you are told that LegalCO only provides a
medium for interaction. Therefore, Legalco will not be liable for any financial loss, fraud,
fraud or any type of crime on the part of both the lawyer and the service recipient. You
agree to all terms and conditions by installing the App/web or taking the Service from
legalco.Legalco reserves the right to change prices and rules, policies and to remove or
ban any user or any lawyer from the platform.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>Clarification Regarding Lawyer-Client Relationship.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>LegalCO operates as a platform that enables communication between
lawyers and potential clients; however, it does not function as an agent for
lawyers. Sending electronic communications solely to LegalCO does not
establish a lawyer-client relationship between the user and LegalCO, as
this is explicitly disclaimed.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>LegalCO does not endorse any specific users.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>Its purpose is to assist individuals in need of legal representation in finding
lawyers who are most suitable for their specific requirements. LegalCO's
intention is not to serve as a platform for advertising or solicitation, and the
content provided on the app/website should not be interpreted as legal
advice.LegalCO may suggest subscribing lawyers only if they align with a
user's needs, and not otherwise. The use of LegalCO, whether through
transmission or receipt, does not establish a lawyer-client relationship.
Individuals who receive content from this app/website should not make
decisions to act or refrain from acting solely based on its contents. We
encourage users to independently review lawyers' profiles and make
well-informed choices.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>In particular, LegalCO does not facilitate any form of solicitatio</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>The platform ensures that client information remains concealed from
lawyers until direct communication occurs between the client and lawyers,
either through direct contact or online interaction. Consequently, lawyers
are not permitted to access private details about potential clients.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>LegalCo does not offer legal advice.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>The 'Common Needs' feature of LegalCo uses only user-provided content to
generate basic documents. The information in the 'FAQs' section is not
considered legal advice; it simply addresses commonly asked questions about
creating wills, drafting lease agreements, issuing cheque dishonor notices,
sending money recovery notices, granting power of attorney for rent collection,
and other potential document types that may be included over time. Users are
recommended to seek guidance from legal professionals for specialized
assistance with any of these documents.</p>
                    <p className='text-justify'>Restrictions on 'Common Needs' Feature Usage:</p>
