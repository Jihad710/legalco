          <p className="  mb-4 mt-5 ">We appreciate your presence with us. We commend your desire to avail the
services we offer. When you explore, evaluate, and make purchases from our
services, we want to ensure that you have a rewarding experience. Just like any
purchasing endeavor, there are applicable terms and conditions within our
company. Our attorneys will condense as much as you allow. The key point to
remember is that by placing an order or engaging in a transaction with us, you
agree to adhere to the terms of our privacy policy. If, for any reason, you find
yourself less than fully satisfied with any service we provide, hesitate not to reach
out, and you can discuss any issues you may have with our services.

          Customer Information

          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          We express our gratitude for your purchase of services or products via our app/ website,
www.legalco.com.bd, hereinafter referred to as "LegalCO." Please carefully review this policy
and the LegalCO terms and conditions, as they offer crucial insights into your rights and
responsibilities as our customer concerning any purchase or service we extend to you.
          </p>
         
          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          We exert our best efforts to deliver services according to the specifications and timelines
specified for each purchased service or product from LegalCO. However, if, due to unforeseen
circumstances, we're unable to provide the service or product you acquired, you shall be eligible
for a refund, subject to the following conditions:
          </p>
         
          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          - A refund will only be considered if there is a clear, evident deficiency in the purchased service
or product from LegalCO.
- Should a customer pay for a service and subsequently request a refund solely due to a change
of mind, the refund won't be processed, as no fault or defect lies with LegalCO.
- Refund requests won't be accommodated after the work has been shared with you in cases of
a change of mind. However, you'll have the option to apply the paid amount towards an
alternative LegalCO service of equal value, partially or wholly.
- Refund requests raised 30 days after the completion of a service or product purchase, and
after communication indicating completion, will be considered invalid.

          </p>
          
          <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          Once LegalCO approves a refund request, you'll receive an email notification. The refund
process might take a minimum of 7 business days and will be credited to your bank account. We
handle this process meticulously, ensuring your money is returned promptly.
